7. Write a java program 'MyNumber.java" that performs following operations on a variable
'num' of type double: 
a) Finds the round value of 'num' and stores the result in a variable numRound of type double. 
b) Finds the ceil value of 'num' and stores the result in a variable numCeil of type double.

overloading.

11. Write a Java Program which prompts the user to enter 4 numbers. The program will then
computes and display their sum and their product.

12. Write Java program involving two classes: OddAndEven and TestOddAndEven. OddAndEven
has the following:  Instance varaibales countOfOdd and countOfEven both of type int  A
method addNumber that takes a number as parameter and increment countOfOdd, if the
number is odd, else increment countOfEven.  A method toString that returns a string in the
form: “Number of Odd: x, Number of Even : y”, where x and y are the values of the instance
variables. The TestOddAndEven class first creates OddAndEven object, then in a loop, read a
number and use it to call the addNumber method until the user enters Q. Finally, it prints
the count of odd and even numbers entered.

13. In a small firm employee numbers are given in serial numerical order, that is 1, 2, 3 etc. write
a menu driven program to perform following operations:

b) Append the data of a new employee joining the firm.
c) If a given employee leaves, delete his record. 
d) If gross salary of a given employee increases, update the gross salary. 
e) Display the record of (i) a given employee or (ii) all employees.

14. Design a class Circle and implement the following methods:
 -  Define a circle method to compute its area
 -  Define a circle method to compute its perimeter
 -  Define a method that takes a given point represented by a pair of numbers and 
    checks whether or not the point is inside the circle.

The circle class needs to have instance variables to store the radius of the circle, and
the x and y coordinates of the center. Add main program to test the class Circle repeatedly,
until user enters negative value for the radius of the circle.

15. The certain instructor assigns letter grade for his course based on the following table:
Score   Grade
>= 90   A+
>= 85   A
>= 80   B+
>= 75   B
>= 70   C+
>= 65   C
>= 60   D+
>= 55   D
<50     F

Write a class, Grader, which has an instance variable, score, an appropriate constructor and
appropriate methods
- a method, letterGrade() that returns the letter grade as a String.

Now write a demo class to test the Grader class by reading a score from the user,
using it to create a Grader object after validating that the value is not negative and is not
greater then 100. Finally, call the letterGrade() method to get and print the grade. See figure
(b) for sample run.

16. Write a program to make use of a parameterized method inside a class. Take the following
case: Create a class Box and define a method in this class which will return the volume of the
box. Initialize two objects for your class and print out the volumes respectively.

17. Implement a Student class with the following fields, constructors and methods : 

Fields:
  name;
  totalScore;
  numberOfQuizzes;
Constructors:
  public Student(String name, double score)
  public Student(double score, String name)
  public Student(String name)
Methods:
  public String getName()
  public double getAverage() //this should return zero if no quiz has been taken.
  public double getTotalScore()
  public void addQuiz(double score)
  public void printStudent() //this should print the student’s name and average score
  public String toString()

Write an application TestStudent that reads a student name and use the Student
class to create a Student object. Then read the scores of the student in three quizzes
and add each to the totalScore of the student using addQuiz() method and print the
student object.

18. Write a program to design a class to represent a bank account. Include the following members.

Date members
- Name of depositor
- Account Number
- Type of account
- Balance account in the account

Methods:- 
- To assign initial values
- To deposit an account
- To withdraw an account after checking balance.

19. Implement a superclass Person. Make two classes, Student and Instructor, inherit from
Person. A person has a name and a year of birth. A student has a major, and an instructor
has a salary. Write the class definitions, the constructors, and the methods toString for all
classes. Supply a test program that tests these classes and methods.

20. Write a program where interface can be used to support multiple inheritances. Develop a
standalone Java program for this.

21. Implement the classes for the shapes using an interface for the common methods, rather
than inheritance from the superclass, while still Shape as a base class.

22. Write a program that calls a method that throws an exception of type ArithmeticExcepton at
a random iteration in a for loop. Catch the exception in the method and pass the iteration
count when the exception occurred to the calling method by using an object of an exception
class you define.

29. Write a graphics program that draws a clock face with a time that the user enters in a text
field. (The user must enter the time in the format hh:mm, for example 09:45. ). Hint: You
need to find out the angles of the hour hand and the minute hand. The angle of the hour
hand is harder; it travels 360 degree in 12 x 60 minutes. Your output must be in the
following format:

30. Define a class Employee having private members – id, name, department, salary. Define
default and parameterized constructors. Create a subclass called “Manager” with private
member bonus. Define methods accept and display in both the classes. Create n objects of
the Manager class and display the details of the manager having the maximum total salary
(salary+bonus)

31. Write a Java program to create a super class Vehicle having members Company and price.
Derive 2 different classes LightMotorVehicle (members – mileage) and HeavyMotorVehicle
(members – capacity-in-tons). Accept the information for n vehicles and display the
information in appropriate form. While taking data, ask the user about the type of vehicle
first.

32. A bank maintains two kinds of accounts - Savings Account and Current Account.The savings
account provides compound interest, deposit and withdrawal facilities. The current account
only provides deposit and withdrawal facilities. Current account holders should also
maintain a minimum balance. If balance falls below this level, a service charge is imposed.
Create a class Account that stores customer name, account number, and type of account.
From this derive the classes Curr-acct and Sav-acct. Include the necessary methods in order
to achieve the following tasks.
a. Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance.
b. Display the balance.
