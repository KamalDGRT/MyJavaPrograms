Features of java :
1) Simple :
   Java is considered as one of the simple language because it does not have complex Features like operator overloading , multiple inheritance, pointers, and explicit memory allocation.
2) Object oriented :
   Object oriented programming is a way of organizing programs as collection of objects, each of which represents an instance of a class.

     2.1 ) Abstraction :
           Abstraction is process where you show only relevant data and hide unnecessary details of an object from the user.
     2.2 ) Encapsulation :
           Binding the data with code that manipulates it.
           It keeps the data and the code safe from external interference.
     2.3 ) Inheritance :
           An object acquires some or all the properties of another object.

     2.4 ) Polymorphism :
           Polymorphism means to process differently based on their data type. In other words, one method with multiple implementation for a certain class of action.

           2 types of Polymorphism :
               Method overloading : Static Polymorphism
               Method overriding  : Dynamic Polymorphism

3) Robust language :
   Early checking for possible errors. The main features of Java that makes it robust are :
      * Garbage collection
      * Exception handling
      * Memory allocation

4) Secure :
   We don't have pointers and we cannot access out of bound arrays in Java.

5) Distributed :
   We can create distributed applications - RMI , EJB,

6) Multithreading :
   It is a java feature that allows concurrent execution of 2 or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.

7) Portable :
   It is platform independent.


Principle of Java :
   "Write once, run anywhere."

  // Hello world statement.
  public static void main ()
  public : access specifier . this makes the main method public. That means, we can call the method from outside the class.
  static : we do not need to create object for static methods to run. They can run on their own.
  void : it does not return anything.
  main : It is a method name. This is the entry point method from which JVM can run your program.
  String[] args : used for command line arguments that are passed as strings.
